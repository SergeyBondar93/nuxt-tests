# Repository Context

## Purpose

This repository is a **testing and exploration playground** for experimenting with various features and capabilities of:

- **Nuxt** (Vue.js framework)
- **Nuxt Modules** (extending Nuxt functionality)
- **Nitro** (Nuxt's server engine)
- **Azure Static Web Apps** (deployment target)

## Philosophy

This is **not** a production application. Instead, it contains **minimalistic examples** and proof-of-concepts demonstrating:

- How different Nuxt features work
- Integration patterns with Nuxt modules
- Nitro server capabilities and API routes
- Azure Static Web Apps deployment configurations
- Edge cases and advanced use cases

## Structure

Each example or feature test should be:
- **Self-contained** - Easy to understand in isolation
- **Minimal** - Only the code necessary to demonstrate the concept
- **Well-documented** - Clear comments explaining what's being tested
- **Reproducible** - Can be run and verified independently

## Current State

- Fresh Nuxt 4 project setup
- Basic configuration
- Ready for exploration and experimentation

## Guidelines for Contributions

When adding examples:
1. Keep them focused on a single concept or feature
2. Add comments explaining the "why" not just the "what"
3. Consider edge cases and gotchas
4. Document any Azure-specific configurations needed
5. Note any Nitro-specific behaviors or requirements
